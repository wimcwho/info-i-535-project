# Title:
Distributed K-Means and Image Clustering
# Description: 
This project aims to implement a distributed K-Means class utilizing PySpark in order to do clustering on datasets thats are too large to fit inside the memory of a single machine, and to operate faster than doing single machine on disk computations. The project then operates on both the iris dataset from Sci-Kit Learn and weather images from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jehanbhathena/weather-dataset).
# Use: 
This project can be operated by importing the Jupyter notebook and the archive.zip data file into one folder on a cluster that supports PySpark distributed programming.
